## **1. Introduction**
Testing is a cornerstone of backend development, ensuring that APIs are reliable, performant, and secure. Python offers a variety of tools for testing, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. This document provides a **comprehensive comparison** of three popular testing tools:
- **Pytest**: A feature-rich testing framework.
- **HTTPX**: A modern HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Unittest**: Python’s built-in testing framework.



## **2. Comparison**
| Feature | Pytest | HTTPX | Unittest |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| Async Support | ✅ Yes (via `pytest-asyncio`) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Simplicity | ✅ Very Simple | ⚠️ Requires external assertions | ❌ More Verbose |
| Built-in Assertions | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Plugin Ecosystem | ✅ Extensive | ❌ None | ❌ Limited |
| Test Discovery | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Needs external framework | ✅ Automatic |
| Best For | Unit & Functional Tests | API & Integration Tests | Structured Unit Tests |
